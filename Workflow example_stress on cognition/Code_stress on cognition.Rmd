# Calculating effect size and variance

In this case we will use lnRR, but standardised mean differences (e.g., Cohen's D can also be used and will produce comparable results).


To quantify differences in individual performance in cognitive assays with stress, we used the logarithm of response ratio (lnRR) calculated as:
$$
\ln{\text{RR}_\text{stress}} = \ln \left(
{\frac {M_\text{stress}} {M_\text{control}}} 
 \right)
$$

Variance was calculated as:

$$
\text{var}(\ln{\text{RR}_\text{stress}}) =
\frac{SD_\text{stress}^2}{N_\text{stress} M_\text{stress}^2} + \frac{SD_\text{control}^2}{N_\text{control}M_\text{control}^2}
$$ 
Note that I have already calculated lnRR and variance previously as the data used in the meta-analysis which was bit more complicated than normal - we will calculate it using the function *escalc* in the "practice together" dataset. 

# Meta-analysis
```{r}
mod_S0 <- rma.mv(yi = lnRR, V = lnRRV, random = list(~1|Study_ID,
                                                          ~1|ES_ID,
                                                          ~1|Strain),
                 test = "t", 
                 data = dat)

#yi = effect size, V = variance, random = a list of your random effects (these will always include study ID and effect size ID)

summary(mod_S0) #global effect size
i2_ml(mod_S0) #heterogeneity: The I2 informs the proportion of the variance in observed effect is due to variance in true effects rather than sampling error
```

Creating an orchard plot:
Checkout the vignette on how to make cool plots https://daniel1noble.github.io/orchaRd/
```{r}
orchard_plot(mod_S0, mod = "1", group = "Study_ID", data = dat, xlab = "lnRR", alpha=0.4)

```

**Fig.1** Orchard plot showing meta-analytic mean and 95% confidence interval (thick black line) and 95% prediction interval (thin black line). Individual points show observed effect sizes scaled proportionately to their precision.

# Meta-regression 

To explain some of the unexplained variation in the main effect of stress model, we conducted a series of uni-moderator analyses. We calculated marginal R\^2 for each moderator as well as conducted a series of pair-wise contrasts between moderator categories.

Any moderator categories with k \< 5 were removed.

## Type of assay

The broad category of the type of assay used to measure learning or memory.

```{r}
dat$Type_assay<-as.factor(dat$Type_assay)

mod_S1 <- rma.mv(yi = lnRR, V = lnRRV, mod = ~Type_assay-1, random =   list(~1|Study_ID,
                                                                                    ~1|ES_ID,
                                                                                    ~1|Strain),
                 test = "t",
                 data = dat)

summary(mod_S1)
r2_ml(mod_S1) #marginal R2 "variance explained by only fixed effects"
```


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
orchard_plot(mod_S1, mod = "Type_assay", group = "Study_ID", data = dat, xlab = "lnRR", alpha=0.4) 
```

**Fig. 2** Orchard plot showing the group-wise means of the categorical variable 'Type_assay' with their 95% confidence interval (thick black line) and 95% prediction interval (thin black line). Individual points show observed effect sizes scaled proportionately to their precision. k is number of effect sizes followed by the number of studies.


## Age at stress

The age when individuals were exposed to stress.

```{r}

mod_S2 <-rma.mv(yi = lnRR, V = lnRRV, mod = ~Age_stress_exposure-1, random = list(~1|Study_ID,
                                                                                       ~1|ES_ID,
                                                                                       ~1|Strain),
                test = "t",
                data = dat)
summary(mod_S2) 
r2_ml(mod_S2) 
```


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
orchard_plot(mod_S2, mod = "Age_stress_exposure", group ="Study_ID", data = dat, xlab = "lnRR", alpha=0.4) 
```

**Fig. 3** Orchard plot showing the group-wise means of the categorical variable 'Age_stress_exposure' with their 95% confidence interval (thick black line) and 95% prediction interval (thin black line). Individual points show observed effect sizes scaled proportionately to their precision. k is number of effect sizes followed by the number of studies.

# Publication bias

## Funnel plot

Note that this is just an example of a funnel plot and it is best to plot it from a full-model with the moderators used in the meta-regression

```{r}
funnel(mod_S0, xlab = "lnRR", ylab = "Standard Error")
```

**Fig. 4** Funnel plot showing the standard error and residuals (lnRR) from the full model.
