## Calculating lnRR and Variance
``` {r}

#note that I have already arcsine transformed the means and SDs as the collected data was proportion data (i.e., bounded by 0 - 100). I used arcsine instead of log as lnRR can't take negative values. If you transform means, also need to transform SDs (using squareroot transformation).

# we could also have used standardised mean differences such as Cohens D. lnRR is common in ecology as sample sizes can sometimes be unequal between groups which isn't as much of an issue with lnRR. 

lnRR <- escalc(measure = "ROM", n1i = dat$n_HP, n2i = dat$n_LP, m1i = dat$mean_HP_transformed, m2i = dat$mean_LP_transformed, sd1i = dat$sd_HP_transformed, sd2i = dat$sd_LP_transform)

#joining the calculated lnRR and (yi) and variance (vi) into a new dataframe
